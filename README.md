# AFirebaseCRUDApp
A Simple Firebase CRUD Application made as a project for Database Systems in 3rd Semester
This app was used to demonstrate the concepts of CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update and Delete) using the Firebase Realtime Database.
I used Android Studio as the IDE of my choice. 
Fully functional.
